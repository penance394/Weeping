Weeping is ment for linux os, not windows if you try and run the file on windows it will not work unless you install zsh.

To use the multi tool, go into your linux terminal and go to the directory the file is in.
  Then do zsh weeping_angel and it will run

You don't need to run it in sudo, although i reccomened you do as some features will not work if it is not ran as sudo.
